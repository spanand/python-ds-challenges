# Python for Data Science - Challenges

## Overview
This repository is a hands-on Python learning journey designed for aspiring data scientists.  
It contains a series of progressive challenges that teach fundamental Python concepts and basic data analysis techniques using real CSV datasets.  
By completing these exercises, you'll gain practical experience in data handling, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic insights computation.

## Challenges
The repository includes the following challenges:

1. **Student Info Dictionary** – Learn variables, lists, dictionaries, and printing.
2. **Even/Odd Separation** – Practice loops, conditionals, and list manipulation.
3. **Class Report CSV** – Read CSV files and filter data based on conditions.
4. **Average Score Function** – Compute averages and identify top performers.
5. **Top Grade Analysis** – Extract maximum values and associate additional data.
6. **Grade Classification** – Categorize students into letter grades (A/B/C/D) and count occurrences.
7. **Sales Insights** – Analyze sales data by region and compute totals/averages.
8. **Data Visualization** – Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
9. **Intro to Machine Learning** *(planned)* – Simple prediction models using scikit-learn.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spanand/python-ds-challenges.git
